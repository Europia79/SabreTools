# SabreTools.Filter

This library contains classes and helpers revolving around filtering and field manipulation. These methods are centered around the internal models that are defined in `SabreTools.Models`. Most of these methods also involve reflection, so it is unlikely that this will be a candidate for NativeAOT.
